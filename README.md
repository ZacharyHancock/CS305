Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a financial institution that wants to address security concerns in its system.

What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
  I feel like I did the static white box testing well. By looking at the code and analyzing it before even running it, I could find security vulnerabilities just in the lack of secure coding practices. It is important to secure code as the end-user relies on      the fact that the back-end of the system is protecting them and not allowing any unauthorized access to information, especially in a financial institution. Adding software security to a company adds to its overall well-being by protecting it from attackers and             increasing the customer's trust. This ultimately will boost their companies' respect and consumer base reputation.

Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
  The most helpful part of the vulnerability assessment was the dependency check tool, that tool allowed a quick automated way of analyzing multiple dependencies without manual entry. This saves so much time in the end.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I increased layers of security by updating old vulnerabilities as well as analyzing error handling and input validation. To better assess vulnerabilities in the future I would utilize penetration testing to see the effects that an attack would have on the application, ultimately allowing me to cover more security holes.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
To ensure the code was functional and secure I utilized debug runs as well as further white box testing. After refactoring I would check to see whether I introduced new vulnerabilities by continuing testing and debugs and compare the results to previous ones to double-check that my implementations didn't introduce more issues. 

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Resources that I used were looking back at resources as well as utilizing online coding forums, tutorials, and YouTube to look at similar implementations to understand how I would tackle my implementation better.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
What I would show future employers from this assignment would be my documentation to demonstrate the process of assessing security and debugging code and the process of implementing fixes. I believe that the ability to work through issues is good to demonstrate as ultimately it's important to be self-sufficient and a self-learner who can reach the goal efficiently.
